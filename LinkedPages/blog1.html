        <h2>The Basics of Strength Training:</h2>
        <ul>
          <li>Compound Exercises:</li>
          <p>
            Start with compound exercises that work multiple muscle groups
            simultaneously. Examples include squats, deadlifts, push-ups, and
            lunges.
          </p>
          <li>Progressive Overload:</li>
          <p>
            To build strength, you must gradually increase the intensity of your
            workouts. Add weight or repetitions over time to continually
            challenge your muscles.
          </p>
          <li>Rest and Recovery:</li>
          <p>
            Muscles need time to recover and grow. Don't overtrain. Aim for 48
            hours of recovery between working the same muscle group.
          </p>
          <li>Balanced Workout Routine:</li>
          <p>
            Ensure a balanced workout targeting all major muscle groups,
            including legs, chest, back, shoulders, and core.
          </p>
        </ul>
      </div>

        <h2>Nutrition:</h2>
        <p>
          Proper nutrition is essential for strength training. Ensure you're
          consuming enough protein to support muscle repair and growth. A
          balanced diet with fruits, vegetables, lean proteins, and healthy fats
          will provide you with the necessary nutrients.
        </p>

          healthier, stronger you. It's not just about lifting weights; it's
          about improving your overall well-being. By setting clear goals,
          working with professionals, and adhering to a balanced workout
          routine, you'll develop the foundation for a lifetime of strength and
          vitality. Remember, consistency is key, so stay committed to your
